I will present Qgoda at the
[German Perl Workshop 2018](http://act.yapc.eu/gpw2018/) in Gummersbach near
Cologne on April 4th, 2018.  The talk will probably be held in German but
I can also switch to English on request.

The talk will include an introduction to static site generators in general,
I will also outline the motivation for writing Qgoda, how it differs from
other static site generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and a complete walk-through for creating a
site like the [Qgoda web-site](http://www.qgoda.net/) with Qgoda.

You can register at the [GPW 2018 website](http://act.yapc.eu/gpw2018/).
The price list is online at http://act.yapc.eu/gpw2018/preise.html.
