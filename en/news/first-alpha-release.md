The first alpha release of Qgoda is now available at [github](https://github.com/gflohr/qgoda/releases).

Two major features are not yet fully implemented:

- Only content from view template can be translated with PO files.
- The computation of related documents is only partly implemented.  The final version will also honor common taxonomy values like tags and categories, not only links as of today.

The main purpose of the release is to allow downloading a tarball from github.
