The first beta release of Qgoda v0.9.2 is now available for download at [github](https://github.com/gflohr/qgoda/releases).  Albeit a beta version, it is mostly functional.

The most important enhancements compared to the alpha version 0.9.1 are:

* exhaustive multi-language support, including content translation with `.po`
files
* docker container for simple installation (thanks to
[Dominic Sonntag](https://github.com/sonntagd) for contributin)
* automatic generation of table of contents
* better computation of related documents
* version control mode that only deploys files that are under version control
* countless bugfixes

The [Qgoda documentation](http://www.qgoda.net/en/docs/) is still incomplete
and not always accurate.  Feel free to abuse the 
[Qgoda bug tracker](https://github.com/gflohr/qgoda/issues) for all kinds
of questions.
