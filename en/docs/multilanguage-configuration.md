Internationalization (i18n) in Qgoda has to be explicitely activated in the configuration file `P:_config.yaml`.

## Global Configuration

A typical multilanguage configuration in `P:_config.yaml` looks like this:

```yaml
linguas: [en-us, bg, de]
po:
  textdomain: net.qgoda.www
  msgid_bugs_address: Guido Flohr <guido.flohr@cantanea.com>
  copyright_holder: cantanea EOOD <http://www.cantanea.com/>
  reload: 1
```

### `linguas`

This is a list of language identifiers complying to [RFC4647 section 2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4647#section-2.1) but without any asterisk (`*`) characters. An asterisk would not make sense here anyway.

The first language is the default language of your site.

The variable is mandatory!

### `po.textdomain`

An arbitrary identifier for your website. The only restriction is that it has to be a valid filename for your operating system. Popular choices are the reverse hostname of your site (like `net.qgoda.www`) or just a simple string like `messages`. It really doesn't matter much.

This variable is also mandatory.

### `po.msgid_bugs_address`

An address where translators should report problems with the original text to translate. The variable is optional.

### `po.copyright_holder`

The copyright holder of the original content. The variable is optional.

### `po.reload`

Set to 1 if you want translations to be visible immediately after they have been compiled into `.mo` files.

Normally translations are loaded only, when Qgoda starts and then cached. Setting `C:po.reload` to 1 results in a little performance penalty but may be useful while you are translating the site.

### `po.md_extra`

A list of [file name patterns]([% q.llink(name='pattern-lists') %]) for additional markdown files. By default, all documents with front matter are potentially considered translatable. If your site has other markdown files that should also be searched, you can list them here.

This variable is optional and rarely used. 

### `po.views`

A list of [file name patterns]([% q.llink(name='pattern-lists') %]) for template files to search for translatable strings. It defaults to just `P:_views` or whatever the configuration variable `C:path.views` points to.

### `po.xgettext_tt2`

The location of the `xgettext_tt2` program if it is not in `$PATH`. The `xgettext_tt2` ships with [Template-Plugin-Gettext](https://github.com/template-plugin-gettext) which is automatically installed with Qgoda.

### `po.xgettext`

The location of the `xgettext` program if it is not in `$PATH`. The `xgettext` program is normally installed as part of a software package called `gettext` or `gettext-tools`.

### `po.msgfmt`

The location of the `msgmerge` program if it is not in `$PATH`. The `msgmerge` program is normally installed as part of a software package called `gettext` or `gettext-tools`.

### `po.msgmerge`

The location of the `msgmerge` program if it is not in `$PATH`. The `msgmerge` program is normally installed as part of a software package called `gettext` or `gettext-tools`.

### `po.qgoda`

The location of the `qgoda` program if it is not in `$PATH`.

### `po.from_code`

The character set of your content, defaults to `utf-8`. Setting this variable to anything else but `utf-8` is a recipie for trouble.

## Configuring the Document Language

Qgoda has to know which language a particular document is written in. This mean in practice that you have to set the `V:asset.lingua` to an appropriate value, that is a language identifier complying to [RFC4647 section 2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4647#section-2.1) but without any asterisk (`*`) characters.

You have several options to set `V:asset.lingua`:

### Per Document

You can set the language in the document front matter:

```yaml
---
title: Kalevala
lingua: fi
name: kalevala
---
```

### Per Directory/Pattern

You can save typing by specifying defaults for `V:asset.lingua` in the global configuration file `P:_config.yaml`:

```yaml
defaults:
  - files: 
      - /en
      - *.en.md
    values:
      lingua: en
```

This would set `V:asset.lingua` to `en` for all files in the top-level directory `/en` and addtionally for all files that have names ending in `.en.md`. See [% q.lanchor(name='defaults') %] and [% q.lanchor('pattern-lists') %] for more information.

## Language-Independent Identifier `asset.name`

All language variants of the same content should share a common property that acts as a link between them. Although you are free to use any vbariable name that you like, `V:asset.name` is used throughout this documentation.

For obvious reasons, this identifier will always be configured in the document front matter.

Take for example a markdown file `special-relativity.md`:

```yaml
---
title: Special Relativity
lingua: en
name: special-relativity
...
```

If the German translation of that file is `spezielle-relativitaetstheorie.md`, that translation's front matter will look like this:

```yaml
---
title: Spezielle Relativit√§tstheorie
lingua: de
name: special-relativity
...
```

Both documents are alternate versions of the same content. They differ in the property `V:asset.lingua` but they share a common  value for the  `V:asset.name` property.

Now it is trivial to link from the English version of that document to the German version:

```tt2
<a href="[% q.link(name=asset.name lingua='fr') %]>German version</a>
```

And you can link from other documents to the document about Einstein's special relativity regardless of the language like this:

```tt2
See [% q.anchor(name='special-relativity' lingua=asset.lingua) %]!
```

See [@ q.lanchor(name='referencing-languages') @] if that does not make sense to you, or if you are looking for a more concise version.

## File and Directory Structure

## Content Negotiation

Content negotiation happens when a web server ([nginx](http://www.nginx.com/), [apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), ...) selects the appropriate language version of a piece of content based on the visitor's preference laid forth in their browser language preferences.  See [Simple Content Negotiation for Nginx](http://www.guido-flohr.net/simple-content-negotiation-for-nginx/) for all the gory details of that. Contrary to what the name of the article suggests, it will shed sufficient light on the topic also for users of other web servers than nginx.

Content negotiation can be made arbitrarily complicated. In practice there is one single valid strategy: A visitor of your start page `http://YOURDOMAIN` should be redirected to the start page in their preferred language and from that moment on they should be pinpointed to that language until they change it. That means that you have to implement content negotiation only for the start page which simplifies things a lot. This is because there is only room for one `/index.html` and the best strategy is to make that just an entry point that brings you to the content in your preferred language.

Server-side solutions are described at the above mentioned blog post [Simple Content Negotiation for Nginx](http://www.guido-flohr.net/simple-content-negotiation-for-nginx/) but as a fallback and short of better ideas feel free to steal the start page for this site from https://github.com/gflohr/qgoda-site/blob/master/index.html.
